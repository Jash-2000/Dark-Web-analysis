As white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups around the world continue to be investigated by various law enforcement agencies, users on forums like Iron March will have a growing
incentive to hide their true identities and mask their communications. Using forums like Iron March will continue to expose members of white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups to
hacktivist “doxing” (or the hacking, stealing and release of information designed to expose the people in question to public scrutiny) and law enforcement observation.

But the history and internal dynamics of Iron March show that a website that facilitates an open and vibrant online discussion can be critical to the early success of the 
white supremasist and neo-Nazi organizations like the ones discussed in this piece. As noted above, several groups, like Atomwaffen Division, got their start, defined their
group doctrine and recruited their first members using Iron March. As white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups continue to create and manage more secure web platforms for this
exact purpose (see here and here), the recently leaked Iron March data provides critical insight into how these types of online platforms may continue to operate and what 
factors drive activity on those sites.

Overall data visualization of the IronMarch dataset is as follows:
