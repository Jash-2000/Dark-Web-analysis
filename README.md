The project aims at using advanced machine learning methods on graphs and apply them to scrapped dark-web data, so as to predict future crimes. 
This would help in further analysis of the commited crimes.

We have primarily used [Node2vec](https://snap.stanford.edu/node2vec/) whose brief and precise explaination has been provided in the **[this]()** presenatation.

## Data Collection

  * Developed a secure pen‑drive mounted connection to the Dark Web using I2P and TOR. Tails OS was the primary OS used.
  * Scripted an automated web spider using Python‑Selenium wrapper, that snowballed between various Dark‑web directories to extract useful data, using CRISP‑DM approach
