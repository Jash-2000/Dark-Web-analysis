Nulled is an online forum board with over 3.9 million members as of 2021, mostly used by cyber criminals to trade and purchase leaked or hacked information. In 2016 it became 
known as the target of a data breach which helped law enforcement to obtain information about possible "suspects", who were registered on Nulled.

Nulled.io is a forum where roughly 500,000 users have discussed leaks, monetization methods, cracks, and coding. The website is also a place where people buy and sell services, products and compromised credentials.

On May 6, hackers leaked a 1.3Gb archive containing a 9.45Gb database file that stores the details of more than 536,000 Nulled.io user accounts, including usernames, email addresses, hashed passwords, registration dates and IP addresses.

Hackers also made available over 800,000 personal messages exchanged by the site’s users, and thousands of purchase records and invoices.

Nulled.io’s VIP users are also affected by the breach. The compromised database contains a table for VIP access payments, including IDs that can be matched to specific users, payment methods, dates, amounts, and PayPal email addresses. VIP users are probably displeased with the fact that they paid to access content that has now been made public.

Additionally, researchers found that the leaked data includes API credentials for payment gateways, authentication logs, geolocation data, and donation records.

Risk Based Security has analyzed the exposed email addresses and found that some of them are hosted on government domains from the United States, Philippines, Jordan, Brazil, Malaysia, Macao and Turkey.
